# oci-hackathon-staterkit

Deploy on OCI an always Free environment to start developing an application.

The deployment contains all required network resources (VCN, Subnets, Security Lists, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, ...) , a compute instance as application server and an HeatWave MySQL Instance with HeatWave Cluster, Lakehouse and MySQL REST Service (MRS).

This initial infrastructure is an excellent starting point for a hackathon project.

The same modules are used as Resource Manager Stack.

The latest stack can be downloaded directly in the releases (the zip file)
